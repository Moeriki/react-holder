# react-image-holder

**TODO: unit tests**

An image component for React which can render real images and placeholder images generated using [holder.js](https://github.com/imsky/holder/).

This allows you to develop using placeholder images until you have real images available to show. Then when it comes to switch you can use the same component and simply update the `src` property.

And thanks to holder.js you can use placeholders even when offline.

$ npm install react-image-holder
```
